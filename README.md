# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Auto-Scaling Infrastructure using Terraform + Jenkins CI/CD
This project demonstrates how to **design, deploy, and automate** a complete AWS infrastructure using **Terraform** (IaC) and **Jenkins** (CI/CD automation).  

All resources were **successfully deployed, validated, and later destroyed** to avoid costs ‚Äî following real-world DevOps practices.

## üß© Project Summary

- Built an **AWS VPC** with public/private subnets across two AZs  
- Deployed **EC2 instances** via Auto Scaling Group (ASG) behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**  
- Configured **CloudWatch Alarms** and **SNS alerts** for monitoring  
- Set up a **Jenkins pipeline** that automatically runs `terraform plan` and `apply` on each GitHub push  
- Verified **ALB health checks**, **scaling activity**, and **CI/CD automation**  
- Destroyed all infrastructure responsibly using `terraform destroy

## üöÄSteps Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)
- Created **VPC**, **subnets**, **route tables**, **IGW**, and **NAT Gateway**  
- Configured **security groups** for EC2 and ALB communication  
- Deployed **ALB**, **Target Group**, and **Auto Scaling Group**  
- Bootstrapped EC2 web servers using `user-data.sh`  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Automation (Jenkins)
- Installed **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, and **AWS CLI** on EC2  
- Added AWS credentials securely using Jenkins credentials manager  
- Configured a pipeline with stages: *Checkout ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Apply*  
- Triggered builds automatically via GitHub webhook  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Alerts
- Added **CloudWatch alarms** for EC2 CPU utilization  
- Integrated **SNS topic** for email alerts  
- Created **target tracking policy** for automatic scaling  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Validation
- ALB ‚Üí EC2 health checks turned healthy  
- Auto Scaling launched new instances under load  
- Verified Jenkins pipeline executed Terraform end-to-end  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup (Proof of Completion)
After validation, all resources were destroyed safely:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve


Deleted resources included:

‚úÖ 1 VPC, 2 public + 2 private subnets

‚úÖ 1 Internet Gateway, 1 NAT Gateway

‚úÖ 1 Application Load Balancer + Target Group

‚úÖ 1 Auto Scaling Group + 2 EC2 instances

‚úÖ 2 Security Groups (ALB + EC2)

‚úÖ 1 SNS topic and CloudWatch alarms

‚úÖ 1 Jenkins EC2 instance (manual termination)

üìâ All resources terminated successfully ‚Äî AWS cost = $0.00 (Free Tier).
